		<p>On December 6th 2018, our class got to get a view of real life jobs that people have gotten based off what we are learning. The trip started after 2nd period when we put our belongings in a safe spot and hopped on board. We then proceded into downtown Memphis where Archer Malmo is located. The bus was good but nearly as as good as the Magic School Bus. Along the way, we joked and viewed the city as we got closer and closer.

	<h2>Inside!</h2>

	<div class="textbox"><P>Once we got off the bus, we were in the heart of downtown Memphis. There was a certain city air with tall buildings all around us! We marched in a group about a block and then entered the Cotton Muesuem where Archer Malmo is located. Once inside we took an elevator a few stories up to our destination. We were greeted by an employee who welcomed us and prepped his computer for us. He started off explaining what he did and how long he'd been there. He then showed us a project sketch he had pulled up. It was very plain, but he explained that that's how most websites started off. He continued on showing us other projects including some finished projects. Along the way he added few tips and tid-bits about his past. He also explained that they hire interns and even hire people from highschool or college based on their skill level. Though he gave some pointers, he was ill-prepared and was very boring, just sayin!
	Once the long presentation was over, we contiued to another floor where they had other employees. It also seemed to be a more entertaining and a relaxed area. Once done we took the elevator down to the bottom floor and presented to us their studio room. Here they explained that they did projects and photoshoots here. The studio does around 150 projects a year and is one of the largest in our area. We were done with our field trip, now it was time to go on an eAt trip at cookout!</p></div>

	<h2>LAST BUT NOT LEAST: FOOD!!</h2>
	<div class="textbox2"><p>After a long time in the offices of Archer Malmo, we left for the bus. However at first glance it appeared that the bus left us! Later though, the bus came and everyone hopped up on board. We continued a little further around the city and then drove into the parking lot. We were all so eager to get food that when the bus stopped to back up eveyone stood up. We all lurched back when she did, and the bus driver scolded at us all. Once inside we tripled their customers!. Luckily, I was on of the first in line. I ordered fries, a hamburger, a large drink, and later on a milkshake. It was pretty cheap, only costing a little over 10 dollars.
	As we sat and ate we talked and made jokes. Later on we got witness Ari gulp an entie cheesecake in like 5 seconds plus have entire milkshake in only 15 seconds. Once we were back on the bus, the bus driver searched for drinks. If she found them, she made the person throw it away! Another 30 minutes or so and we were back at school, but unfortuanetly for us students, Mrs. Sinclair was leaving and we all had to finish the day in 7th period. Mrs. Steeles class wouldnt fit in a 5,000 page book it's so bad! :(. Overall though, the trip was fun and I am glad we got to go!
